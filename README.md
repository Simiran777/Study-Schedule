## Notes
- **Total Study Time**: 17 hours (1.5 + 2.25 + 3.5 + 4.25 + 3 + 1.5 = 17 hours).  
- **Breaks**: Short 5–10 min breaks every 90 min during study blocks (included in study time).  
- **Efficiency Tips**:  
  - Use active recall and spaced repetition for studying.  
  - Prioritize difficult tasks early when cognitive energy is highest.  
  - Stay hydrated and minimize distractions (e.g., phone off during study blocks).  
  - Adjust subject focus based on goals (e.g., exam prep, skill-building).
