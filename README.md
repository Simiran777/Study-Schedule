## Notes
- **Breaks**: Short 5–10 min breaks every 90 min during study blocks (included in study time) to maintain focus.
- **Efficiency Tips**:
  - Use active recall and spaced repetition for studying.
  - Prioritise difficult tasks early (e.g., Study Block 1) when cognitive energy is highest.
  - Stay hydrated and minimise distractions (e.g., phone off during study blocks).
  - Adjust subject focus based on goals (e.g., exam prep, skill-building).
- **Sleep Caution**: 5 hours is minimal and may impact long-term performance. Monitor energy levels.
